# Logic Tree Examples

Worked examples of MECE logic trees for common business problems.

## Example 1: SaaS Churn Increasing

**Problem Statement:** Monthly churn is 6% instead of 3%, starting 2 months ago.

### Math Tree

```
Churn rate increasing (6% → 3% target)
├── Voluntary churn (user decides to leave)
│   ├── Product-related
│   │   ├── Feature gaps (missing functionality users need)
│   │   ├── Bugs/reliability (product not working as expected)
│   │   └── UX friction (too hard to use)
│   ├── Value-related
│   │   ├── Not achieving desired outcome
│   │   ├── Found better alternative
│   │   └── Price no longer justified
│   └── Circumstance-related
│       ├── Budget cuts / downsizing
│       ├── Role change (no longer needs product)
│       └── Project completed (temporary need)
└── Involuntary churn (payment failure)
    ├── Card expiration
    ├── Insufficient funds
    └── Payment processing errors
```

### Hypotheses

| # | Hypothesis | Likelihood | Impact | Testability |
|---|-----------|------------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | If a recent pricing change drove churn, then we'd see churn spike correlating with the price increase date and concentrated in price-sensitive segments | 4 | 5 | 5 |
| 2 | If a competitor launched a compelling alternative, then we'd see increased mentions in exit surveys and competitor signups | 3 | 4 | 4 |
| 3 | If a recent release introduced bugs, then we'd see increased support tickets and churn correlated with bug-affected features | 4 | 3 | 5 |
| 4 | If involuntary churn increased from payment failures, then we'd see higher failed payment rates in billing data | 3 | 3 | 5 |

## Example 2: E-Commerce Conversion Rate Dropping

**Problem Statement:** Site conversion rate is 1.2% instead of 2.5%, down from 3 months ago.

### Math Tree

```
Conversion rate dropping (1.2% → 2.5% target)
├── Traffic quality declining
│   ├── Channel mix shift (more low-intent traffic)
│   │   ├── Paid traffic targeting changed
│   │   ├── Organic traffic keyword shift
│   │   └── Social traffic increase (browsing, not buying)
│   ├── Audience mismatch (reaching wrong people)
│   └── Seasonality / external factors
├── On-site experience degrading
│   ├── Page load speed
│   ├── Mobile experience broken
│   ├── Navigation / UX changes
│   └── Content / product page quality
├── Purchase friction increasing
│   ├── Checkout flow issues
│   ├── Payment method problems
│   ├── Shipping cost/time surprises
│   └── Trust signals missing or broken
└── Offer/pricing issues
    ├── Price competitiveness
    ├── Promotion changes
    └── Stock availability
```

### Data Requirements (Top 3 Hypotheses)

| Hypothesis | Confirming Evidence | Data Source | Owner |
|------------|--------------------|----|-------|
| Channel mix shifted to low-intent | Conversion by channel shows new mix has lower-converting channels growing | Google Analytics | Marketing |
| Mobile experience broken | Mobile conversion dropped more than desktop | Analytics + device segmentation | Product |
| Checkout abandonment increased | Cart-to-purchase rate dropped, specific step with highest drop-off | Checkout funnel analytics | Product |

## Example 3: Content ROI Declining

**Problem Statement:** Content-attributed pipeline is $200K/quarter instead of $500K/quarter.

### Issue Tree

```
Content-attributed pipeline declining ($200K → $500K target)
├── Reach problem (fewer people seeing content)
│   ├── Organic search traffic declining
│   │   ├── Algorithm changes
│   │   ├── Keyword rankings lost
│   │   └── Fewer pages indexed
│   ├── Social distribution declining
│   │   ├── Posting frequency decreased
│   │   ├── Engagement rates down
│   │   └── Algorithm reach reduction
│   └── Email distribution declining
│       ├── List size shrinking
│       └── Open/click rates declining
├── Engagement problem (people see but don't engage)
│   ├── Content quality declining
│   ├── Topics not resonating
│   └── Format mismatch with audience
├── Conversion problem (engage but don't convert)
│   ├── CTAs not effective
│   ├── Conversion path broken
│   └── Offer not compelling
└── Attribution problem (converting but not tracked)
    ├── Tracking broken
    ├── Attribution model changed
    └── Pipeline reporting methodology changed
```

### Key Insight

Always include "measurement changed" as a branch. Sometimes the problem isn't performance — it's how you're counting.

## Example 4: B2B Pipeline Velocity Slowing

**Problem Statement:** Average deal cycle is 90 days instead of 60 days, and win rate is 18% instead of 25%.

### Math Tree

```
Pipeline velocity declining
├── Deal cycle lengthening (90 → 60 days)
│   ├── Top-of-funnel stage extending
│   │   ├── Lead quality declining (more unqualified leads entering)
│   │   ├── SDR response time increasing
│   │   └── Qualification criteria unclear
│   ├── Middle-of-funnel stage extending
│   │   ├── Stakeholder count increasing (more approvals needed)
│   │   ├── Competitive evaluation taking longer
│   │   └── Proof-of-concept/trial taking longer
│   └── Bottom-of-funnel stage extending
│       ├── Legal/procurement delays
│       ├── Budget approval process changed
│       └── Champion turnover mid-deal
└── Win rate declining (18% → 25%)
    ├── Competitive losses increasing
    │   ├── Feature gap vs. specific competitor
    │   ├── Price competitiveness
    │   └── Brand perception / trust
    ├── No-decision losses increasing
    │   ├── Status quo preference growing
    │   ├── Budget prioritization shifting
    │   └── Business case not compelling enough
    └── Qualification issues
        ├── Wrong-fit deals entering pipeline
        └── ICP definition needs updating
```

### Segmentation Approach

For B2B pipeline problems, always segment analysis by:
- **Deal size** (enterprise vs. mid-market vs. SMB)
- **Source** (inbound vs. outbound vs. partner)
- **Segment** (industry or use case)
- **Rep** (individual performance variation)

Often the "average" hides that one segment is fine and another is broken.
