# Orchestrate Research

*Meta — Stack orchestrator. The entry point for the research-skills stack when you don't know what to invoke.*

**Core Job:** read what's been done, infer where you are in the research pipeline, propose the next skill.

**Core Question:** "Given what's already in `research/` and `skills-resources/`, plus what you just asked, what's the highest-leverage research skill to run next?"

This skill does NOT execute research work. It is a router and progress-tracker. The actual research is done by the skill it routes you to (icp-research, market-research, diagnose, prioritize, funnel-planner).

---

## When To Use

- You just installed the research-skills plugin and don't know what to type.
- You're mid-project and forget which skill is next.
- You have a vague research need ("understand my market", "figure out who buys this", "why are conversions tanking") and want a guided routing.
- You want to resume a workflow across sessions — re-running `/orchestrate-research` re-reads state and resumes from the next step.

## When NOT To Use

- You already know which skill to run — just run it directly. This skill is overhead for users who know the stack.
- You want cross-stack guidance (e.g., "research → marketing → product"). Use `/orchestrate-meta` or compose conversationally.
- You want to execute research yourself rather than route. This skill only proposes and hands off.

---

## How It Works

**Tier note (`metadata.budget: fast`):** This is a pure router — no sub-agent dispatch, no critic gate. The body below runs in-line: read state, parse intent, propose next skill, await user confirmation. No `agents/` directory, no L1/L2 layers, no rewrite cycles. The premium-orchestration substrate (multi-agent + critic) lives in the skills this router proposes; running it here would be theater.

1. **State detection** — silently read `research/`, `skills-resources/`, and `skills-resources/experience/*.md` to build a picture of what's been done.
2. **Intention analysis** — parse the user's free-form ask (or, if empty, ask one scoping question). Map intent to a position in the research pipeline.
3. **Routing decision** — propose the next 1–3 skills with rationale. Show what each consumes and produces, expected cost, expected duration.
4. **User confirmation** — user picks one (or none, or a different skill). On confirmation, hand off — recommend the user invoke `/<skill-name>` with the appropriate args.

The skill never auto-invokes another skill. It always pauses for explicit user confirmation. This is the anti-runaway guard.

---

## Step 1: State Detection

Silently read state. Do not announce findings until Step 4 — keep the read invisible.

**Disk snapshot** (rendered inline when `/orchestrate-research` is invoked — see `meta-skills/CLAUDE.md` §"Skill-Authoring Patterns" for the inline-shell-interpolation convention):

```
Artifacts by domain:
! `[ -d skills-resources ] && find skills-resources -mindepth 2 -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | awk -F/ '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | grep . || echo "  (no skills-resources/ yet)"`

Top-level canonical folders present:
! `found=0; for d in research brand architecture; do [ -d "$d" ] && { echo "  $d/ ✓"; found=1; }; done; [ $found -eq 0 ] && echo "  (none yet)" || true`

Last 5 commits in this repo:
! `git log --oneline -5 2>/dev/null | grep . || echo "no git history"`
```

The `! \`...\`` lines run at slash-command invocation time and substitute the command output — so the orchestrator starts from concrete state instead of speculating about what's on disk.

**Read `skills-resources/manifest.json` first** — this is the canonical state index. Single file, single read; no per-path scanning required.

If the manifest is missing or looks stale (check `updated_at` drift), regenerate it:

```bash
bun ${SKILLS_ROOT:-.claude/skills}/meta-skills/scripts/manifest-sync.ts
```

**Status-aware lookup** — for each artifact relevant to the research stack, read its manifest entry's `status` and `stale` fields to qualify the state map:

| Manifest signal | State map value |
|---|---|
| `status: done`, `stale: false` | ✅ done |
| `status: done_with_concerns` | ⚠️ done-with-concerns — surface the concern in routing output |
| `status: blocked` or `needs_context` | treat as missing |
| `stale: true` | ✅ done (stale) — propose refresh as an option, don't block |
| `frontmatter_present: false` | ✅ done (legacy, no frontmatter) — quality unknown, suggest refresh |

Staleness is now derived per-artifact via the manifest's `stale_after_days` (default 90, overridable per artifact). Read the manifest entry's `stale` field directly — no manual date arithmetic needed.

**Experience block** — also read the manifest's `experience` block. `audience.md` and `business.md` `entries` counts indicate Pre-Dispatch coverage for research-stack questions. Low entry counts (≤2) mean cold-start conditions are likely for downstream skills.

See [`../../../meta-skills/references/manifest-spec.md`](../../../meta-skills/references/manifest-spec.md) for the full contract.

**Path reference / filesystem fallback** — used only when `skills-resources/manifest.json` doesn't exist (fresh project) or sync hasn't been run:

| Path | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| `research/product-context.md` | ICP foundation exists. Audience is at least sketched. |
| `research/icp-research.md` | Full ICP research is done. |
| `research/market-research.md` | Market landscape mapped. |
| `skills-resources/meta/records/[date]-diagnose-[slug].md` | A specific problem has been diagnosed. |
| `skills-resources/meta/sketches/prioritize-[slug].md` | Initiative ranking exists. |
| `skills-resources/meta/records/targets-[slug].md` | Funnel targets are set. |
| `skills-resources/research/short-form-research/[slug].md` | Per-platform short-form catalog exists. |
| `skills-resources/research/short-form-eval/[date]-cycle-N.md` | Short-form eval cycles have run; pattern-log entries available. |
| `skills-resources/experience/audience.md` | Cold-start audience answers persisted. |
| `skills-resources/experience/business.md` | Business model context persisted. |
| `skills-resources/experience/research-workflow.md` | Prior `/orchestrate-research` session left a breadcrumb. |

Build a **state map** — a small internal table:

```
icp-foundation:    done | partial | missing
market-landscape:  done | partial | missing
problem-diagnosis: done | partial | missing | n/a
prioritization:    done | partial | missing | n/a
funnel-targets:    done | partial | missing | n/a
```

---

## Step 2: Intention Analysis

Parse the user's argument (the free-form ask). Match against intent buckets:

| User says | Intent | Pipeline position |
|---|---|---|
| "understand my customer", "who buys this", "personas", "voice of customer" | audience-research | icp-research |
| "market sizing", "TAM/SAM/SOM", "competitors", "market landscape", "whitespace" | market-mapping | market-research |
| "why is X dropping", "root cause", "metric decline", "diagnose this problem" | problem-diagnosis | diagnose |
| "what should we build", "prioritize features", "ICE score", "options ranking" | option-ranking | prioritize |
| "revenue targets", "funnel math", "how much traffic do I need", "unit economics" | target-setting | funnel-planner |

**If the ask is empty or ambiguous**, do NOT silently default to icp-research. Ask one bundled scoping question:

> "What are you trying to learn? Pick one or describe in your words:
>
> 1. Who's actually buying this / who should be (audience)
> 2. What the market and competitors look like (landscape)
> 3. Why a specific metric is moving the wrong way (diagnose)
> 4. Which initiative to bet on next (prioritize)
> 5. Whether the revenue math actually works (targets)"

Wait for answer. Do not proceed without one.

---

## Step 3: Routing Decision

Combine state map + intent. Apply routing rules in order — first match wins.

**Routing rules:**

1. **No icp foundation + any audience-or-strategy intent** → propose `icp-research` first. Rationale: 13+ skills downstream consume `research/product-context.md`. Skipping it produces hollow output.
2. **icp done + market intent** → propose `market-research`. Rationale: with audience defined, market landscape becomes targeted (which segment owns which competitor, etc.).
3. **icp done + diagnose intent** → propose `diagnose`. Note that `diagnose` requires a *specific* problem statement; if user says "things feel off," push back and ask for a metric.
4. **icp + (market or diagnose) done + prioritize intent** → propose `prioritize`. Rationale: it consumes both upstream artifacts.
5. **prioritize done + targets intent** → propose `funnel-planner`. Rationale: it consumes prioritize.md.
6. **icp done + user intent ambiguous** → propose **2 options** (market-research and diagnose) with one-line rationale each. Let user pick.
7. **No clear intent + everything done** → say so. "All five core artifacts exist and look fresh. You're past the standard research pipeline. Did you mean to refresh one, or do you need a different stack?" — suggest `/orchestrate-marketing` or `/orchestrate-product`.

**Edge cases:**
- **Stale icp** (older than 90 days, or product description in `CLAUDE.md` doesn't match): warn but don't force a rerun. "Your icp is 4 months old. Refresh it before market-research, or proceed with current?"
- **Wants to skip** ("I just want prioritize"): respect it. Run prioritize. But note in output: "Without market-research, prioritize will rely on whatever context you put in the prompt. Output quality drops accordingly."

---

## Step 4: Present + Confirm

Output format — keep it scannable, no walls of text:

```
## Where you are

- ICP foundation: ✅ done (research/icp-research.md, 2 weeks old)
- Market landscape: ❌ missing
- Problem diagnosis: ⊘ n/a (no specific problem in your ask)
- Prioritization: ❌ missing
- Funnel targets: ❌ missing

## What you asked

"I want to understand my market" → market-mapping intent.

## Recommended next: market-research

Why: ICP foundation is in place; market-research consumes it and produces
the landscape your prioritize step will need.

Cost: ~$1–3 · Duration: ~10 min · Produces: research/market-research.md

Run it?  →  /market-research
```

If multiple options apply (rule 6), show 2–3 with rationale per option, ask the user which.

---

## Step 5: Persist + Hand Off

After the user confirms, write a breadcrumb to `skills-resources/experience/research-workflow.md`:

```markdown
## Session 2026-05-06

- Read state: icp ✅, market ❌, diagnose ⊘, prioritize ❌, funnel ❌
- User intent: market-mapping
- Recommended: market-research
- User confirmed: yes
```

Keep this file append-only. Future `/orchestrate-research` invocations read it to detect "user already did X two sessions ago, don't re-propose it."

Then present the hand-off line:

> Run `/market-research` next. After it completes, re-run `/orchestrate-research` to plan the next step.

That's it. Skill exits. The user invokes the next skill themselves — this skill never auto-invokes.

---

## Pipeline Reference

For the canonical pipeline definition, decision rules, and per-skill catalog, see [`./references/workflow-graph.md`](./references/workflow-graph.md).

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't ignore the manifest** — always read `skills-resources/manifest.json` first; per-path filesystem scans are a fallback, not the default.
- **Don't summarize all 6 skills** in the output. Propose 1–3 specific ones for THIS user's state.
- **Don't auto-invoke** the recommended skill. The user must explicitly type `/skill-name`. This is the anti-runaway guard.
- **Don't re-derive the pipeline** from scratch each invocation. Read it from `references/workflow-graph.md`.
- **Don't lecture about the pipeline** — show the user only what's relevant to where they are.
- **Don't silently start over** when a workflow breadcrumb exists. Read it. Acknowledge it. Resume from there.

---

## Output

- **Inline only** — this skill prints to the conversation, doesn't produce a saved artifact.
- **Side effect:** appends one entry to `skills-resources/experience/research-workflow.md`.

## Status

Always ends with one of:
- `DONE` — recommendation given, user confirmed, hand-off line printed.
- `BLOCKED` — couldn't read state (no project context, no `CLAUDE.md`, no `skills-resources/`). Ask user where the project lives.
- `NEEDS_CONTEXT` — user's ask was empty AND no state exists. Ask the scoping question, return after answer.
